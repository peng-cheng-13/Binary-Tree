# I.Introduction
The Binary Tree workflow is a synthetic benchmark consisting of processes that each consume and produce a single file. 
Each file is consumed by two children until the desired depth d, and the w proceeds unevenly.

# Structure


#Usage
1. Set environments for Binary Tree workflow in "new-submit" file
    a. TOOL_DIR, the dir that contains the task files written in different langerages(POSIX , JAVA, C-JNI)
    b. DEPTH, the depth of Binary-tree workflow, the minimum depth is 2
    c. DATA_SIZE, the data size(MB) that produced by each job
    Tips: The dax file will be generated by "generate-dax" file. Modify this file if needed.

2. Submit workflow
    run "./new-submit" command.
